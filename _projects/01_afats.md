**AFATS**, short for *Away From All The Shit*, is a homepage or new tab document alternative.

The basic purpose of the project is to have a same homepage for searching internet and custom quick links throughut all the devices and browsers. Its first version did not used any backend technologies or database. That version used jQuery and HTML5 LocalStorage to store each users data. But to make it same across all browsers and devices it is redesigned in MEAN stack.
